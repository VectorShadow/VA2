    // player's loadout. If the player unlocks and builds an upgrade, it should be automatically swapped in,
    // and any items tracked by it should be transferred over.
    // For example, if a player has a basic reagent pouch capable of a grimoire and three individual reagents,
    // and then upgrades to a more advanced pouch with space for four reagents, any grimoire and reagents currently
    // equipped in the pouch should be loaded into the new one, then the appropriate slot here loaded with that.
